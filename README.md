# Blockchain-Based-Secure-Storage-of-Genomic-Data
A blockchain-based storage system that ensures integrity, security, and decentralization. Our approach leverages AES encryption for data privacy, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus for integrity, and Flask-based APIs for accessibility. The system is deployed on AWS, making it scalable and publicly accessible.
